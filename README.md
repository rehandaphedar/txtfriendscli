# txtfriendscli
I wrote a simple bash script that allows you to view people's [friends.txt](https://sr.ht/~thecashewtrader/friends.txt) files.

# Usage
```
Usage: ./txtfriendscli.sh [-s siteURL] [-m menu] [-h]
    -h Print usage and basic information
    -s The website url without https:// or the trailing /friends.txt (just the domain)
    -m The menu you would like to use. Default is fzy but other options include: whiptail, dialog, dmenu, and rofi
```
